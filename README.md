## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - JS library
- [React-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

### Continued development

I would like to re-do the CSS from scratch at a later date. There is no figma file for this and I'm studying for a react interview so I skipped the CSS.
